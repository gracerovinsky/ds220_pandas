    "# Data Analysis of Popular Songs\n",

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project analyzes a dataset from Kaggle of the most popular songs on Spotify to gain a better understanding of trends in modern music. The dataset includes data about songs (release date, artist count, number of streams) along with popularity in charts/playlists from Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, and Shazam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding trends in popular music is relevant because the streaming data reflects real life patterns. From a data science perspective, this dataset provides an example of how data can be analyzed to make insights into listener behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through data analysis, I will explore the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What makes a song popular?\n",
    "- How do specific features of a song (energy, valence, danceability, speechiness) correlate with number of streams?\n",
    "- Which artists dominate the charts overall?\n",
    "- Which release months and years are most common among the most popular music?\n",
    "- How do different platforms vary for artists?"

    "## 5. Insights & Narrative\n",
    "\n",
    "Insight 1: Collaboration Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Songs with 2 or more artists have higher average stream counts than solo songs. This suggests that collaboration across multiple artists' fanbases increases the popularity of a song.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insight 2: Recent Songs' Popularity\n",
    "\n",
    "The highest average streams come from songs with more recent release years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insight 3: Attributes of Popular Music\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular songs typically have high danceability, high energy, moderately high valence. From our data analysis, we can see that these attributes tend to increase the popularity of a song. This fits the mainstream pop trends, as most pop songs are pretty upbeat and energetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insight 4: Popular BPM Ranges\n",
    "\n",
    "Most popular BPMs cluster around 90–110 BPM and 120–130 BPM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Insight 5: Release Dates\n",
    "\n",
    "Peak months for popular releases appear around June–August, as upbeat music tends to do well during the summer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "Modern popular music on streaming platforms favors collaborative tracks, high energy, danceability, releases in more recent years, recognizable keys, tempo ranges optimal for dancing to. These insights could help artists aiming to optimize their releases for streaming success.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Conclusion\n",
    "Using this dataset, we identified patterns in artist collaboration, release timing, and various features of songs that correlate with high streaming performance. While correlation does not imply causation, the trends point toward a recognizable formula in modern pop music for streaming success.\n"
